The handbook is served from gh-pages branch on github

run the `build.sh` script to compile gitbook and move the html into the top level folder

note that you will need to have gitbook-cli and rsync installed for the script to work

run `serve.sh` to test that the handbook is working (needs python3 installed) before pushing the compiled html to gh-pages branch on gitbook
