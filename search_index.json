Handbook\nIf you're looking for introductory information about Enspiral, check our website enspiral.com, this quick slideshow, or this 90 second video.\nIf you're looking for stories, check out Enspiral Tales our collective blog.\nYou might also be inspired by this video created at Enspiral Summer Fest 2018 by our friends the Digital Story Tellers.\nAbout This Handbook\nThis Handbook's primary audience is Enspiral contributors, but it will be publicly available for others who might find it useful. The goal is to give everyone in the network as much clarity and context as possible, while sharing our structures and practices with the outside world as well.\nThis book is in perpetual beta, it's constantly changing. If you see something that could be improved: that's your invitation to improve it! Find out more about editing the handbook.\nStructure\nThe book is broken up into chapters and sub-chapters. The chapters are:\n\nAgreements are the official legislation that governs the Enspiral network. Changing these requires a formal process.\nGuides explain in practical terms how we do stuff, like what communications tools to use, or how to improve things at Enspiral. Any Enspiral Contributor can change these.\nWorking Groups Working groups are where we do work on the network.\nEnspiral Foundation - the central node in the network. The Board, Ops Team, Comms person, and Ventures all have some formal arrangement with the Foundation, which is owned by all the Enspiral Members.\nMoney - a lot of what makes Enspiral special is how we deal with money. Read more about those processes in this chapter.\nVentures - the companies that make up the network.\n\nOther Handbooks\nThe information in this handbook pertains to Enspiral Foundation Limited and the Enspiral network as a whole. Many Enspiral ventures and teams will have different processes, which live in their own handbooks e.g.:\n\nThe Loomio Cooperative Handbook\n\nThere's an increasing number of companies outside of Enspiral that are also documented with public handbooks:\n\nCrisp DNA\nGini handbook\nGitlab Company Handbook\nThoughtbot Playbook\nValve Company Handbook\n\nif you have a handbook of your own, add it here or ping @richdecibels on Twitter\n\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

As a registered limited liability company, Enspiral Foundation Ltd is legally required to have a board of directors and a chairperson.\nEnspiral’s goal is to distribute vision, strategy, and leadership as widely as possible in the network, so our approach is a “minimum viable board” (MVB), with a narrow compliance focus.\nRoles & Responsibilities\n\nEnsure Enspiral Foundation Ltd is fully compliant with New Zealand laws and regulations, and its company constitution.\nMaintain an overview of current finances, long term financial view, and adequate reserves (as defined in the Financial Agreement).\nDecide what kind of financial activity can go through the Foundation, and oversee activity in the Foundation’s accounts.\nOversee all agreements between Enspiral Foundation Ltd and other entities (including Enspiral Ventures and external organisations), such as memorandums of understanding (MOUs - see definition), service contracts, fundholding arrangements, etc.\nMake recommendations about substantive decisions involving Enspiral Foundation Ltd and its assets, consulting with the shareholders and wider network.\nReport quarterly on its activities to the shareholders and wider network.\n\nSelection & Composition\n\nMembers (shareholders) and existing directors are expected to actively maintain a diverse board in keeping with the Diversity Agreement.\nEnspiral currently has no quota or strict compositional requirements of the board as we do not want to limit the spectrum of diversity considered.\nDirectors do not need to be Enspiral Members, and the perspectives of non-member directors should be welcomed.\n\nProcesses\nDefined by the company Constitution:\n\nDirectors not disqualified under the Companies Act can be appointed by the shareholders of Enspiral Foundation Ltd (Enspiral Members) with 75% support.\nDirectors can be removed by the shareholders of Enspiral Foundation Ltd (Enspiral Members) with 75% support.\nThere will be a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 8 directors at any one time.\nThe Directors must elect one of their number as chairperson of the Board.\n\nFurther defined by this agreement:\n\nThe board of directors will meet at least quarterly.\nDirectors serve a term of a minimum of 2 years and a maximum of 5 years.\nDecisions about appointing and removing directors will be made in the Enspiral Members Loomio group.\nAny Enspiral member may nominate a new Director.\nAll directors must become Enspiral Contributors, in order to have access and context on network activity.\nThe Chair is selected by a 'paper, scissor, rock' process (best 2 out of 3), with the loser becoming the Chair of board for 12 months.\n\nEmergency Powers\nUnder New Zealand law, the Board can take extreme unilateral action, a power Enspiral aims to apply only in rare emergency situations, such as the following risk areas:\n\nFinancial bankruptcy or solvency risk\nIllegal conduct and legal disputes\nExtreme brand/reputation risk\nBreakdown of normal decision-making processes\n\nIn these cases the board has powers including liquidating the company, terminating contracts, disabling online platforms, commandeering funds, and any other actions the directors deem necessary to meet their legal responsibilities and allowed under the Companies Act.\nExpectations\nDirectors will:\n\nRegularly participate in Enspiral's online and offline collaboration spaces, such as Loomio discussions, members meetings, and retreats.\nMake themselves available to answer questions and hear concerns from anyone at Enspiral regarding the Enspiral Foundation, and their roles and responsibilities as board members.\nConduct themselves in a manner which upholds the values of the network and enhances Enspiral’s reputation.\n\n"},"agreements/brand.html":{"url":"agreements/brand.html","title":"Brand Agreement","keywords":"","body":"Brand Agreement\nNote: this agreement is not about ‘branded Enspiral ventures’ or Enspiral associated ventures/companies. For now potential ventures go through the venture process. We have identified that that work needs wider input and alignment with the people working on clarifying Enspiral ventures.\nThis agreement is explicitly for anyone to use the Enspiral brand to align with their project, initiative, venture etc and get the right support and help they need to make it happen.\n‘X by Enspiral’ can be used for things like…\n'supported by, powered by, associated with, sponsored by...\nUnder this agreement to use the brand in this way all you need to do is:\n(1:) Articulate your initiative by using this form\nThe purpose of this form is to act as a risk register and ask some reflective questions that further the thinking of the person behind the project, whilst providing some rigour of thinking to people outside of the project.\n(2:) Gain approval from 3 members of the working group.\nThis will require you to reach out and chat about your idea with at least 3 people in the Brand Working group. It’s a good chance to circulate your idea in the network, gain momentum for it and also get valuable feedback to see risks, issues and opportunities you might not have seen yet.\nWhen you’ve got this crew behind you, you can go for it and use the brand on your amazing, innovative, risky-as-hell or safe-as-houses new 'Supported by Enspiral' project.\nIf you fail spectacularly and publicly, you'll have our support. Innovation is messy - and running with clear intent and failing is a great thing. If you succeed, awesome. No doubt the network will continue to support you.\n"},"agreements/catalyst.html":{"url":"agreements/catalyst.html","title":"Catalyst Agreement","keywords":"","body":"Agreement: Enspiral Catalysts\nContext\nIn chemistry, a Catalyst is an agent of change, used in small amounts relative to the reactants, which reduces the amount of energy required to create a reaction, and activates the rest of the system without itself getting consumed. \nWith Catalysts at Enspiral, we are attempting to take the function of executive leadership, share it across multiple agents, and cycle many people through the role under a set time limit. The goal is to maintain a rhythm of evolution at Enspiral by inviting contribution, participation, and action, whilst reducing the friction people encounter trying to make changes and improvements.\nRoles & Responsibilities\nAs leaders, Catalysts are responsible for defining and managing their own work. The specific functions below are intended to only occupy a small fraction of a Catalysts committed time, with the rest spent on their self-directed work programme.\nSupport Working Groups and Make Their Work Easier\nThe primary responsibility of Catalysts is to catalyze working groups and help them be more productive. This can involve activities like strategy setting, co-facilitation, conflict resolution, fund raising and recruitment. Catalysts exist to support the work, not do the work.\nInterface Between Working Groups and the Network\nCatalysts are a focal point in the attention economy. They are responsible for maintaining a list of active working groups and ensuring their activities are communicated succintly to the wider network. They are also responsible for supporting people who wish to join working groups find somewhere to contribute.\nMaintain a Prioritised Network Improvements List\nThe Improvements Board is the catalysts responsibility. They are responsible for keeping it up to date and ensuring that working groups activity is clearly represented and that ideas for new improvements are frequently reviewed and considered.\nHold Working Group Rhythms\nCatalysts are responsible for facilitating key rhythms and decisions for the ecosystem of working groups as a whole.\nProcesses\nAppointment\nThe Catalyst support working group is responsible for selecting and supporting catalysts.\nResourcing\nThe Catalyst support working group is responsible for raising funds through cobudget or other means to fund on-going catalyst work.\nExpectations\nEach Catalyst will have their own style of leadership, and diverse approaches are strongly encouraged. However, there are some guiding principles we expect all Catalysts to follow.\n\nGentle - exercise power with others, not over others.\nFirm - hold people to their commitments, especially yourself.\nSelfless - subsume your personal motivations to those of the group.\nKind - care for the people, care for yourself. Ask for and offer support.\nAmbitious - aim for high standards in both yourself and others.\nInclusive - consistently create opportunities for all kinds of people to engage. \nCatalysing - consciously develop leadership capacity in yourself and others.\nHolistic - regard the bigger picture, the longer term, and the network as a whole.\n\n"},"agreements/decisions.html":{"url":"agreements/decisions.html","title":"Decisions Agreement","keywords":"","body":"Decisions Agreement\nThis agreement defines how formal decisions are made at Enspiral. It identifies a number of different types of decision-making protocols, and describes processes for participating in formal decision making.\nContext\nEnspiral is a network of highly autonomous individuals, teams, and ventures. As much as possible, we encourage people to make decisions for themselves.\nEnspiral is also a network building shared commons, and pursuing shared aspirations, that call for collective agreements and commitments. There are a variety of situations where it is useful or necessary to make a formal decision as a group.\nDecision Protocol: Consensus\nFor formal decisions, Enspiral uses consensus decision-making, a methodology with a specific meaning and practice. Consensus does not mean unanimous agreement or engagement from everyone on all decisions. The key concept is consent (you can live with it), which is distinct from agreement (it’s your preference or first choice).\nAgreements\nFormal decisions with everyone are only intended to be used when they will have significant impact on the wider network. This Decision Agreement is the core agreement from which all others derive their mandate.\nIn order to enable efficient decision-making, provide clarity to participants, comply with laws, and protect the network, certain formal decisions are delegated to specific people, groups, or processes other than a consensus decision. This delegation is an Agreement and they are documented in our Handbook. Decisions to change existing Agreements or create new ones are made by everyone in the network together.\nDecision Tool: Loomio\nAt Enspiral, formal decisions are made using a software tool called Loomio, which helps groups make collective decisions using constructive deliberation. This process is based on the principle that diverse perspectives can be synthesised to achieve better solutions that work for more people.\nWhile making use of other channels (online and offline) to enrich input into a decision is strongly encouraged, the results on Loomio are considered the official outcome. This is so that we can keep a clear record and archive, and to ensure that everyone who desires to participate in a given decision-making process has the opportunity to make their voice heard.\nNot every Loomio proposal constitutes a formal decision. Many Loomio proposals are created simply to gauge interest or share information. For the purposes of this Agreement, a “formal decision” is a clearly worded Loomio proposal seeking a specific mandate on behalf of the network.\nMaking Formal Decisions\nAnyone can propose a formal decision at any time. We seek open, transparent decision-making and strive to enable the people who are affected by a decision to participate as fully as possible in making it. Enspiral tries to make decisions with the widest possible circle of participants, while recognising the necessity and wisdom of delegating responsibility for certain decisions.\nA formal decision is only required whenever there is a significant impact on the network. It is difficult to specify exact criteria for every case, so everyone is encouraged to use their best judgement to balance exercising autonomy with gaining shared understanding.\nFormal decisions are needed for the following areas (some with the whole network, some with a subset of people or by a process which has been delegated by an Agreement).\n\nAgreements - creating new rules about how Enspiral works\nBrand - using the Enspiral logo and identity publicly\nMoney - spending collective funds or for actions that impact our financial outlook\nTools & Processes - how the network as a whole will work and communicate\nRelationships - commitments as a network with individuals or entities (such as invitations to membership, appointing directors, MOUs with ventures or other entities)\nBuy-in & Awareness - when seeking a shared sense of ownership and support from the network as a whole\n\nDecision Types\nThis agreement sets out the types of consensus decision making protocols that are used within Enspiral. These protocols are named here so they can easily be referred to in other Agreements and contexts, and people can consider which is most appropriate for the situation.\nThe default for all formal decision making in Enspiral is the Standard Decision.\n\n\n\nType\nPassing Criteria\nEngagement Threshold\nMinimum Timeframe\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nStandard Decision\nPasses as long as there are no blocks\nNone\n3 working days (5 working days encouraged when possible)\nThis is the default option and is used for most decisions at Enspiral. Ensures that no one strongly opposes a course of action, while allowing progress to move forward. If there are a large number of “no”s, it’s strongly advised to work on another iteration to find a better solution, but the proposer may move ahead at their discretion.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, we have other types of formal decisions for specific circumstances. When using any of the decision types below, it must be clearly specified in the proposal.\n\n\n\nType\nPassing Criteria\nEngagement Threshold\nMinimum Timeframe\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nSignificant Decision\nPasses as long as there are no blocks and more than 50% of those stating a position agree\nNone\n5 working days (10 working days encouraged when possible)\nThis option should be used for more consequential decisions, such as changes to Enspiral Agreements.\n\n\nQuorum Decision\nPasses as long as there are no blocks.\nRequires at least 75% of all eligible voters to agree or abstain (meaning at least ¾ of all group members must participate)\n5 working days (10 working days encouraged when possible)\nThis option is used when a Special Resolution (as defined in the Constitution) is required\n\n\nEmergency Decision\nPasses even if there are blocks, but requires 75% of those stating a position to agree\nNone\n10 working days. If faster action is required, the board can exercise its emergency powers.\nThis option is a safeguard when the normal decision making processes fails. This option is only used in specific circumstances where a minority block would be destructive, such as removing a member, contributor or venture from the community or a role.\n\n\n\nDiscussions & Proposals\nLoomio decisions are generally preceded by a Loomio discussion. It is recommended to allow space for open discussion before starting a proposal, to give people an opportunity to be actively involved in shaping the context of the decision, and to share relevant information and opinions.\nAny participant can raise a proposal, which describes a clear course of action or resolution. Once a proposal has been created, participants are asked to state a position.\n\n\n\nposition\nmeaning\n\n\n\n\nYES\nYou’re happy with the proposal.\n\n\nABSTAIN\nYou’re happy for the group to decide without you.\n\n\nNO\nYou think there might be a better alternative, but you’re willing to go with the group’s decision.\n\n\nBLOCK\nYou’ve got serious objections and you’ll be extremely unhappy if this proposal goes ahead.\n\n\n\nBlocking\nAt Enspiral, a single block is sufficient to stop a proposal proceeding in most cases. This places a considerable responsibility on someone blocking to deeply consider their choice, and on everyone involved to respect the right to block and to work toward a resolution.\nA decision to block should not be taken lightly, but if you feel strongly about an issue and really want to stop a proposal you actually need to block it, because simply disagreeing or arguing against is not a guarantee that it won't be passed.\nBlocking Policies\n\nPlace the good of the whole group above your own individual preferences.\nYou are not required to propose an alternative solution to raise a block, but you must articulate the nature of your block clearly so the group can understand the concern and work toward a resolution.\nSimply vetoing a decision is not considered a responsible use of consensus blocking - you must be prepared to work collaboratively to try and reach a resolution, make time for conversations, and to help others understand the issue.\nBlocks should only be used in cases where the blocker genuinely believes there is a significant risk of harm to the network, or that the proposal contravenes the fundamental values of Enspiral.\n\nNote: Blocks by Enspiral Members are binding. The question of whether blocks by contributors are or should be binding as well is ambiguous, with people in the community feeling strongly both ways. That ambiguity is intentionally left unresolved in this agreement.\nDecision Culture & Practice\nWhile this document defines our formal decision making protocols, the effectiveness of our decision-making practice depends on our collective culture. The following principles have been found to be helpful in supporting formal decision-making at Enspiral.\nYour Participation\n\nShare your genuine and honest views and opinions.\nBe succinct and clear in your communication.\nModulate the volume of your contributions to leave space for equitable participation from others.\nPractice empathy and ask questions. Listen to understand, not to find fault.\nActively engage in order to help the group make progress.\nBe prepared to have your mind changed - don’t be overly attached to your ideas.\nConsciously embrace diverse perspectives to reveal blind spots.\nAsk for help if you are not adequately engaged or don't understand an issue.\n\nEnriching Engagement\n\nOpen multiple channels to get well-rounded input (not just Loomio, not just online).\nInvolve people who are not in your geographical location and those you do not work with regularly.\nIf you encounter tension, conflict, or confusion, escalate communication to a higher bandwidth channel (Loomio to chat, chat to video, video to one-on-one, one-on-one to mediation by a third party), and then report outcomes back to the group.\nTake considered acts of facilitation to improve the experience of the group overall (examples: inviting in those we have not yet heard from, clarifying and summarising points raised, suggesting good timing for a proposal, etc).\n\n"},"agreements/diversity.html":{"url":"agreements/diversity.html","title":"Diversity Agreement","keywords":"","body":"Diversity Agreement\nEnspiral is committed to developing and fostering a culture of diversity within an equitable workplace where all people are respected and valued.

The recommended duration for this period is one month.\nLoomio proposal in the Members Loomio, following the requirements for a Quorum Decision, and if passed an invitation to join is extended to the venture.\nVenture accepts official invitation to join.\nOperations team (via foundation@enspiral.com) facilitates signing of Venture MOU between Foundation Board and Venture representatives, and set up any financial contribution processing required.\nVenture Stewards ensure profile published in Enspiral Handbook.\nVenture Stewards ensure Logo and link added to Enspiral Website.\nVenture Stewards request an announcement in Enspiral News of the new venture joining, with a link to their Venture profile page.\n\nLeaving\nEnspiral Ventures can leave or be withdrawn in the following ways.\nResignation\n\nVenture contact person sends a written notice of withdrawal as an Enspiral venture to their venture stewards\nOperations team facilitate a formal termination letter signed by the Foundation Board\nVenture Stewards ensure that the Enspiral Handbook and website are updated, and an announcement goes in Enspiral News\nVenture Stewards conduct an off-boarding retrospective to harvest learnings from the experience, which is to be shared as appropriate (with a bias towards openness unless there is sensitive information).\n\nMember Decision\nA Venture can be removed by Emergency Decision of the Enspiral Members (and then follow steps 2-4 above)\nLack of Venture Stewards\nVentures are responsible for making sure they have active stewards, and stewards are responsible for the living relationship between the venture and the network, as the venture and the network evolve over time. If at any point this relationship breaks down, ventures and stewards are encouraged to request support from members and contributors in the network.\nAn inability to maintain three Venture Stewards is a signal that a venture may not be viable, or that the network does not have capacity to support them at this time. If a Venture has not maintained three active Venture Stewards for 90 days or more, off-boarding begins following steps 2-4 under “resignation” above.\nVenture Contributions\nFinancial contributions by Ventures fuel the maintenance and development of Enspiral as a whole, and non-financial contributions make up the web of support and opportunity that makes Enspiral much more than the sum of its parts.\nEach venture defines how they wish to contribute to the network, financially and otherwise. This could be a flat monthly fee, a percentage of revenue, discounts on services, or any other contribution they wish to make. The basis of the Enspiral model is reciprocity and generosity - the expectation is to contribute at a level reasonable to the resources and stage of the venture.\nFinancial contributions are made to the Enspiral Foundation, ideally on a monthly basis. Ventures are invited to participate in our collaborative funding process to decide how the discretionary portion of their contribution will be spent (as defined in the Financial Agreement).\nAdjusting Contribution\nVentures are free to adjust the contribution level specified in their Venture MOU at any time. It is expected that as a venture evolves, so too will its contribution. Ventures are required to communicate clearly about any such adjustments.\n\nVenture contact person lets the Operations team (via foundation@enspiral.com) and their stewards know the new contribution they wish to commit to.\nOperations team prepare a new Venture MOU, which is signed by the Foundation board without negotiation.\nOperations team notify Enspiral News to include an announcement in the next newsletter.\nVenture Stewards ensure the Venture profile is updated with the new contribution information.\n\nAccountability & Information Sharing\nVenture stewards are responsible for ensuring that venture follow through with their responsibilities as defined in this agreement.\n\nVentures are required to submit a quarterly update four times a year, in collaboration with their Venture Stewards.\nVentures are required to keep their public venture profile up to date, in collaboration with their venture stewards.\nVentures commit to financial transparency with other ventures and Enspiral members. The level of transparency is to be agreed with each venture on a case by case basis. \nVentures are required to sign an updated MOU if their contribution commitment changes.\n\nOther Venture Types\nEnspiral Branded Ventures\nAn Enspiral Branded Venture carries the Enspiral name in its title and uses the Enspiral logo as part of its identity. Shared branding presents additional benefits and risks, and so comes with some additional criteria.\n\nAll key personnel must be Enspiral Contributors\nIf the venture leaves the network, they must remove any Enspiral branding from their name and logo\n\nProto-Ventures\nProto-Ventures are entities considering becoming Enspiral Ventures in the future.\nProto-ventures are likely to be:\n\nEarly-stage initiatives connected to people in the network, but are not yet ready to define their team, structure, or model enough to become a full-fledged venture, or\nEstablished external companies exploring the possibility of joining as Enspiral Ventures\n\nTo become a proto-venture, the team identifies three venture stewards (following the same selection criteria as regular ventures), who agree to support their development and exploration. These stewards will facilitate the joining process, if appropriate.\nProto-ventures are not expected to contribute financially, and do not require a Venture MOU. Proto-ventures are invited to participate in quarterly reporting, to make themselves known to the network, update on their progress, and request support.\nProto-ventures may publicly describe themselves as “working with Enspiral” or as a “project of Enspiral”, but may not claim to be an Enspiral Venture or Enspiral Company until they have gone through the full joining process. They are not named as ventures on the Enspiral website or in public communications.\n"},"agreements/working_groups.html":{"url":"agreements/working_groups.html","title":"Working Groups Agreement","keywords":"","body":"Agreement: Working Groups\nApproved: April 2019\nWorking groups are the way we build and maintain Enspiral, if Enspiral were a body, working groups would be the organs.\nTypes of Working Groups\nThere are three types of working groups: informal, formal and financially enabled.\nInformal\nAn informal working group is the easiest to start, it requires no approval and only needs at least two members to qualify as a working group.\n\nAny two people can start an informal working group for any purpose they define.\nIt can be for a short lived project or long term mission.\nThe working group can set its own rules for who can join.\n\nFormal\nA formal working group is a more robust working group with additional powers and responsibilities.\n\nCatalyst approval is required to create a formal working group.\nOnly formal working groups can be delegated responsibilities or powers in an Agreement.\n\nFinancial Enabled\nA financially enabled working group is able to use the Enspiral Foundation Ltd as a financial and legal platform.

Assembly]\nWhat is an Assembly Sprint?\nAssembly Sprints are for organizing the most important discussions and decisions for this season into one place for us to have our say and move the network forwards. Your voice matters, and we invite you to bring your gifts to bear on our collective potential, unfolding the value of our collective, its resources (even its agreements, protocols, tools and shared understandings) and its current and future relationships.\nThe Assembly will typically involve a number of Loomio discussions and some community gatherings (sychronous meetings over video calls and in person when possible). Imagine months of Enspiralling concentrated into two weeks to help a bunch of conversations and proposals move forward.\nAssembly Sprints will concentrate discussions and decisions—those that may have wide ramifications for many Enspiral stakeholders—over a period of two weeks, scheduled well in advance, for the purposes of inclusion, accessibility, transparency, and better synergising collective attention & efforts.\nMost recent threads\nAssembly Opt-in and Agenda announcement for 11 Nov. Sprint: see the current poll in Loomio!\nNovember Assembly Sprint decision and agenda formation\n2019 Retro and decision\nReport back from March 2019:\nDecision to run the March '19 assembly (and the initial one)\nParameters and Process (Semi-outdated)\nThe below was agreed to at a number of stages, first in this thread. While it is not exactly the most current thinking on the process, the parameters are basically accurate.\nParameters\nContributors and Members will be able to participate.\n\nContributors get blocking power if they commit to the two-week sprint\nMembers have blocking power in any decisions in the Assembly Sprint whether or not they “opt-in”\n\nProcess\nFirst, [2-3 months in advance], we would invite public submissions of concrete and/or specific proposals or topics where we imagine we’ll need to make a decision in the next year (e.g., “Roles”/ “Network design for types of stakeholder” will likely be proposed as an October topic, even though the intention is no significant decision would be initiated until at least the following Assembly Sprint).\nThen, [5-9 weeks in advance], GSD would use advice process to elect the decision-areas that are on the agenda—to be moved towards action during the time-boxed, asynchronous Assembly Sprint. [At least a month in advance], GSD will notify the network of what’s on the agenda for the particular dates, and will make an invitation for people to commit/ sign up to participate in the two week endeavour.\nMore on Why/ Background\nDecision-making 'assembly' sprints—if run regularly, a few times a year—could increase accessibility, supporting more people to be able to participate in shaping the network as their intrinsic motivation calls them to. By picking a two-week period several months in advance, and choosing which decision-areas are on the agenda, we can grow everyone's capacity to voice their values and share their wisdom on the issues that matter most to them.\nHopefully, this will result in conditions of more coherence, transparency, and accountability in the process of decision-making that affects our Agreements, and will give each of us an opportunity to indicate the commitment that feels right for a given set of significant (or substantial) decisions in a given season. @joshuavial outlined this approach in his document, 4 Worlds (link → relevant header), which you may have seen posted after the Members' meeting before last.\nPast records\n2018\nAll Retro Comments and some Metrics and synthesis — (inaugural) 2018 Assembly\nDecision to run the first Assembly Sprint (and the second)\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

This is a bucket of money that anyone in the network can contribute to. Rich arbitrarily hands out money to people for writing, editing and illustrating blog posts.\nAt 01/08/17, there is $2,000 in the bucket - so get writing, get paid :)\nContent\nThe content is diverse. We don’t need to have a strong editorial opinion about what kind of content to publish, as the internet decides what is interesting. Here’s some of the kinds of posts that seem to do well.\nDecentralised Leadership\nBetween us we’re learning a lot about decentralised leadership. Alanna Krause writes about it, Jessy Kate Schingler writes about it, Richard D. Bartlett writes about it, and so does Susan Basterfield. These pieces are really valuable to people trying to follow in Enspiral’s footsteps.\nVision conjuring\nSome people do big epic visionary change-the-world pieces like Joshua Vial’s Hacking Capitalism with Capped Returns and Edward West’s piece announcing the Collaborative Technology Alliance. These are the kind of pieces a community can grow around.\nExperience sharing\nSome people share their experience of being in Enspiral, which is really helpful context for new folk. See Pete Jacobsen’s Baffling Journey Into Enspiral or Hailey Cooperider’s reflections from her first Enspiral retreat, Vivien Askey’s interview with Jack Tolley, Chloe Waretini’s reflection on the first Catalyst experiment,\nPractical lessons\nThen again some people share more practical lessons like Mix Irving’s Teaching in the Spiral: Less Lecturing, More Co-creating, Chelsea Robinsons’s Feedback Feast, Theodore Taptiklis’ on Capturing a compelling story and James Kiesel’s piece on remote working and Sam Rye on the essential tools in your Startup Stack. The internet loves practical guides like this!\nReflecting on events\nBlogging is a great way to digest events, e.g. Richard D. Bartlett’s epic summary of the Democratic Cities conference in Madrid, Silvia Zuur’s review of Bioneers, Tracey Ambrose’s review of OuiShare Fest, Alina Seigfried’s piece about Michel Bauwens’ visit to Wellington, and Derek Razo’s schemes after POC21 as the event morphed into a community. \nEvents are easy to write about, and they tend to get a good level of attention because you can share them on the event hashtag. Event participants are often eager to read the reflections of other attendees.\nEditing\nThere’s no formal editorial system in place. \nAnyone can write a piece on Medium and submit it to the publication for review. Technically, Rich, Alanna, Chloe, Derek, Seb and Gina have “editor” permissions so can approve or edit any submitted post. If you want your name on this list, talk to Rich.\nPractically, Rich has the strongest editorial oversight - chat with him if you’re thinking of a post but not sure if it fits, or want any kind of encouragement. If you don’t know where to start, this short story about writing the minimum viable post might help. He’s currently operating on the principle that more contributors is good: let’s all get in the habit of sharing our lessons in public! Right now he's particularly interested in sharing stories about the challenges and tensions of working in this way, but you might be interested in something completely different and that is cool too.\nLicensing and syndication\nLicensing is up to you. Medium allows you to choose a license, whether you want to reserve all, some, or no rights. This article might help you choose. If you don't actively choose a license, you're effectively giving up all your rights to Medium.\nIf you choose a license that allows people to share your work, it can get reposted elsewhere. This is great to expand the reach of our stories. E.g. Shareable and P2P Foundation both reposted Rich’s Bossless Organisations piece.\nIf you want to make it easier on the editors of those publications, it’s helpful to publish a raw Markdown or Html version of your post somewhere. For example, see how Rich did that at the very end of this post.\nImpact\nThe results have been great: about 40 people have written stories, growing the publication to 2800 followers, getting about 5-10k hits in a month. Here's a summary of our all-time views:\n\nAnd our most popular stories to date (updated Jan '19):\n\n\nResources\n\nUnsplash: free high resolution photos\n\n\nPost script from Rich about Medium vs. free software\nPeople will rightly question: hey why are you supporting Medium over free software alternatives? Aren't they just another venture-backed company capturing the value we peer-produce for the common benefit of the internet!?\nYes they are. Boo. I'm a free software advocate. I've been supporting people to write blogs since literally before blogging platforms were invented. I've rolled my own code, and hosted collaborative blogs on Blogger and Wordpress.\nIn my opinion, Medium has a couple of huge benefits compared to any other tool I've tried. The focus on \"writing a post\" rather than \"starting a blog\", the simplicity of the editor interface, the ease of maintaining an individual and a collective identity, the integration with social networks... all of these factors make it really attractive to new writers.\nI've found it to be orders of magnitude easier to recruit people to write on Medium than on any other platform. I'm optimising for maximum number of contributors.\nMy recommendations:\n\nExport your stories from Medium periodically to make sure you own them. \nUse the licenses to make sure you understand who owns the stories and who can reproduce them on what conditions.\nPut your stories elsewhere and just use Medium as a signal-booster. I've started publishing on Gist with public-domain licensing, so it is easy for anyone to repost my work onto Medium, Wordpress, or anywhere else.\nIf you know of a free software alternative to Medium that is comparable in terms of accessibility and impact, and you want to host Enspiral's blogging platform there, I will be happy to do what I can to support a migration plan.\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

We collectively strive to foster an increasingly open, inclusive and caring culture.  The Well Working Group will support this mission by developing network resources for constructive dialogue and co-working.\nIn this document you will find three suggested steps to take to safely and appropriately resolve conflict. Also included are support mechanisms if you need additional input to help resolve the conflict.\nNote: If you currently feel unsafe in Enspiral's communication channels, please immediately e-mail foundation@enspiral.com.\nIf you or someone you know is in immediate danger, seek local law enforcement.\nWe ask all Enspiral participants to recognize these network safety guidelines for resolving serious conflicts.\nIf you are in conflict with someone else consider taking these three steps:\n1.  Contemplate Conflict\n\nTake time to process experiences if you feel confused, overwhelmed or agitated.\nNote uncertainties and possible misunderstandings in your interactions, including cultural differences.\nDistinguish people's actions from your feelings about them.  They're both important, but they're different.\nDistinguish disagreement from personal hostility.  We're allowed to disagree, dissent and discuss.\nReview relevant documents andConflict Resolution Support.\n\nIf you've contemplated the experience and have decided it feels like it may be harassment or abuse, please consult our Harassment and Abuse Policy.\n2.  Invite Conversation\nIf you're unable to resolve a conflict on your own, invite conversation.  The sooner the better.\n\nIf you feel able and safe to, directly discuss your concerns with the person you are in conflict with.\nOtherwise, see Conflict Resolution Support.\nConsider your communication approach; Comms Guidelines might be helpful.\nEnsure a mutually agreeable time and place for conversation, including adequate privacy.\n\n3.  Develop a Plan\n\nFoster inclusive dialogue by sharing ideas, asking clarifying questions, and responding to others' ideas.\n\nIdentify personal wants and needs.\nMake offers or requests.\n\n\nIn complex conflicts, develop points of agreement to facilitate progress.\n\nPropose plans to treat conflict in a mutually satisfactory way.\nMutually sign written plans in serious cases, or whenever desired.\nFollow up later to discuss progress.\n\nTransformative Justice Support\nAgain, if you've contemplated the experience and have decided it feels like it may be harassment or abuse, please consult our Harassment and Abuse Policy.\nEach of these support stages may be pursued separately or together.\nHow do I know when to enlist more support?\nThe time to escalate is when you've been trying to work at one level and you reach an impasse, both parties unable to compromise in any way.\nFor example, if you have a 1-1 meeting with reasonable, clear asks which become unmet requests, it would be at this point you might consider bringing a third party in to mediate.\nThere are four steps you might consider to reach a resolution, each step includes more people. The point is to resolve the conflict with as few people involved as possible.\n1. Direct communication\nDirectly discuss your concerns with a conflicting person if you're comfortable doing that.  \n2. Private support\nTalk privately to your Enspiral Steward(s) or trusted friends to help you resolve conflicts with other Enspiral participants. Make a plan together about what you're going to do.\n3. Expanded dialogue\nEnspiral participants may seek to informally resolve their conflicts by discussing them with mutually trusted Enspiral participants.  This may be done either confidentially or openly.\n4. Mediation\nFor intense conflicts, Enspiral participants may request mediation meetings which are assigned to trained, in-network (orexternal) mediators.\nOur expectations are that a mediator is suitably qualified, costs incurred will be negotiated directly with the people involved.

By default, assume the whole network will see everything.\nPosting on Loomio in the main Enspiral group won't necessarily alert everyone, but if you invite the whole group to a thread or to vote on a poll, Loomio will notify everyone (sending emails to any of our 200 people around the world, if they haven't changed their settings,) and so should be used judiciously. Big announcements can make a lot of noise if we overuse them.\nFeel free to start subgroups on Loomio if you'd like a more targeted collaboration space with a subset of Enspiral people.\nImprovements - Task management\nThe Improvements board is a place to see work in progress.

If your message is about spending collective money, it probably makes sense to post it here as a bucket or comment.\nEnspiral News - Broadcast\nEvery two weeks, a newsletter goes out to all Enspiral contributors via Mailchimp. It has info from ventures, media coverage, updates on decisions and happenings, and inspirational animal gifs. \nTo get something published in News, email news@enspiral.com or post in the #enspiral-news Slack channel. If you want to reach the whole network with non-urgent infomation, this is the way.\nGoogle Apps\n\nEmail - Everyone at Enspiral can pay a subscription fee to have an Enspiral email address if they need one to represent Enspiral to clients or the public. Email is great for one-on-one or small group correspondence, or one-way announcements. There are more details on the Google Apps page.\n\nCalendar - Great for your own planning and for private events and meetings where you have a specific guest list in mind. \n\nDrive - We use Drive (Docs, Sheets, Forms) extensively, but we're moving all 'official' documentation off it and onto GitHub. If a team you're working with uses Drive, you'll be invited to the relevant folders/docs.\n\n\nFacebook - Casual Asynchronous Comms\n\nPublic Facebook page - Updates, news, and links relavent to Enspiral followers.

Within a given tool, post to the right group or channel:\n\nTopics requiring a group decision and affecting everyone go on Loomio\nIssues, improvements and general discussion go on Github or Waffle\nBroadcast announcements to all contributors go in News\nCasual realtime communication goes on Slack. You will reach whoever opts in to read when you happen to post.\nOther casual communication goes in the Facebook group - again you'll reach whoever opts in there.\nPublic info and links go on Facebook and Twitter\nLong form public sharing goes on Enspiral Tales\n\nMessages relevant only to a limited group of people should be emailed directly, or posted in a specific Slack channel or Loomio subgroup.\nSubject Lines\nPut all the relevant info you can very concisely in the subject line (or discussion title on Loomio). Messages on Loomio trigger an email hundreds of people, many of whom will look no further than the subject line. Who, what, where, why, when.\nKey Details in the First Message\nPut all the relevant details in the body of the message, Chalkle event description, calendar invite, etc. You often only have one shot to reach people. Most will never click through to look at followup comments. Make sure the key info is in the initial post.\nInclude Links, Make it Easy\nIf you want people to click through to other content, include links! People will not go searching for facebook events, google docs, etc, on their own. Put everything they need right in front of people.\nTag Specific People\nIf a post is relevant to specific people, tag them (on Slack, Loomio, Facebook) to help them notice it's there. People will often respond directly to stuff they are tagged in, which can increase engagement. Don’t post a comment that is just tagging a name though - that means the person will get an email notification that simply says their name. You want them to get a message too. \nBe Very Sparing with @Channel tags\nIn Slack, @channel or @everyone notifications will send notifications to everyone in that channel - please use this sparingly for very important or time sensitive information, especially in large channels. Don't use @channel in #watercooler unless it's something that literally affects everyone.\nGet Permissions Right\nIf you’re linking to something on Google Drive (or any other site), make sure you check the sharing settings before you hit send! It’s very common to be given a link only to be told “you don’t have permission” when you try to view it. Most people won’t come back and try again, so get it right the first time.\nInclude All Context\nWrite every message as if to someone who has never heard of it before, especially network-wide messages. Don’t assume people already know any context, since your audience has diverse levels of engagement. We want invitations to engagement to be as accessible as possible. Be aware of Enspiral jargon and assumptions. Include links to relevant background info or previous discussions so people can catch themselves up.\nMake it Count\nSend out as few messages as possible, and use each one to the max. Consider how precious people’s time is. Our attention is a commons we share - if we start overusing it, we'll degrade it for everyone. Do a quick search to see if there’s already an existing thread on the topic before posting a new one. \nAsk for Help\nRealize that any time you’re communicating to large groups of people, you are doing comms work. If you’re not sure, or not very experienced with comms work, just check in with someone who can help you think through your message and how you’re delivering it to make sure it’s maximally effective.\nKeep it brief\n‘nough said!\nIf you need help...\nContact news@enspiral.com to reach Jess, our comms maven. \nDrop into the #enspiral_help channel on Slack\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

It has a system for storing files and proposing changes to them in a managed way. (This is based on an amazing free technology called git.)\nAll the files that make up this handbook live in a Github \"repository\" (often called a \"repo\") : https://github.com/enspiral/handbook\nCheck the Github for Beginners guide if you want to learn more.\nIf you have a Github account, you can draft another version of the handbook and let people comment on your draft. You make a \"pull request\" to request that repo maintainers merge your changes into the canonical version of the handbook, the \"master\" version.\nIf you don't have an account click here to set one up. Once you have an account, post your github user ID in the #enspiral_help channel in Slack and ask for someone to add you to Enspiral' github account.\nTo change an agreement you need to follow the process outlined in the decisions agreement. These agreements govern our community so they can only be changed with community input.\nIf you're making a small edit like fixing a typo, or adding a guide, the pull request is a good place to start.\nHere's how to propose a change:\nWatch the quick demo video, or read on:\n\n  \n\n\nStep 1\nFirst, go to the enspiral/handbook Github repo (you'll need to be a logged Github user). Click \"Fork\" to make your own copy of the repo. It'll ask for a destination: just select your personal account.\n\nStep 2\nNow you're on your own version of the handbook. You can add files with \"Create new file\" or \"Upload files\". To edit an existing file, select it from the list, then click the little pencil icon near the top right.\n\nStep 3\nNow you're in a file editor, so you can make any changes you want. We're using markdown to add formatting, links, images, etc. You can see how this markdown formatting will render by clicking \"Preview changes\". Text outlined in red is the stuff you're proposing to remove, and green means you're proposing an addition. Hit \"Commit changes\" to finish editing.\n\nStep 4\nOnce you've added and edited all the files required to make a useful change to the handbook, go back to your repo (click yourGithubUsername/handbook at the top of the page) and click \"New pull request\".\n\nStep 5\nThis will take you to the enspiral/handbook repo, and give you a preview of the whole set of changes you are proposing. If it looks right, then click \"Create pull request\" and fill in a title and details for the pull request, so people know at a glance what is included. Finally, you need to click \"Create pull request\" once more, which will make your proposal final and notify the repo maintainers that you want to make a change.\n\nHandbook Maintainers\nHandbook maintainers aim to merge pull requests within 1-2 days. As a general guideline a maintainer does not merge in their own branches or pull requests. If they cannot get hold of another maintainer they may merge their own branches.\nTo improve communications and understanding, its useful for your proposed changes to reference an underlying issue that your changes aim to solve.\nIf you want to become a maintainer ask @joshuavial to give to maintainer rights.\nCode to sync github and gitbooks\n## prereqs\nrsync\npython3\ngit\ngitbook-cli\n​\nin the md/ folder, run gitbook install\n​\n## Test\n./serve.sh\nhttp://localhost:8000/\n​\n​git fetch origin\ngit checkout gh-pages\ngit merge master\n./build.sh\n\n## if you need better error messages, try gitbook build .\n\ngit add .\ngit commit -m \"whatevers happened\"\ngit push origin gh-pages\n\n## if you need to make edits, do this on another branch.\n## just use gh-pages to build the html version of the book\nImprovements and Disagreements\nIf you think the content in the handbook is inaccurate or could be improved follow the process above to submit your own changes. The contribution process may reveal differences of opinion. In these cases, try to understand each others perspective. Consider starting a Loomio discussion to find agreement.\nThe Gitbooks Method\nYou can also edit the handbook using the Gitbooks Editor. If you know how to do that, why don't you go ahead and update this page to explain it to someone else :)\n\nUpdating the Table of Contents/Menu\nYou can update the menu by editing the SUMMARY.md file.\n\nPreviewing changes before merging a pull request\nGitbook automatically renders all branches on Github, so you can preview what a pull request will look like before merging it.\nTo do this, go to the Activity tab -> switch branch -> view latest build -> read online.\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

On Github, Google Docs and more.\nIn order to keep what we write up-to-date and consistent, we practice « content dusting ». That is, we keep an eye on the actual content we create through Github and Google Drive to identify the parts that become stale or lose relevance, and suggest amendments where appropriate.\nNote: This process description focuses on Github and Google Drive dusting work right now. If you think similar work should be done on other platforms we use, feel free to edit/amend this document.\nWhat's in with dusting?\nThis group exists as another means to provide easily accessible tasks to contributors who are having a hard time finding how to get involved at a practical level with Enspiral.\nDoing work that has positive impact for the network should not require specific knowledge about our governance practices or processes, and should also be workable for people who have low capacity or want low engagement.\nAmending content and discussing with content authors are also means to directly connect to arguably the most important part of Enspiral - what gets done. By creating more direct collaboration dynamics, we envision that engagement in « working on stuff that matters » will naturally follow, and that durable cross-network connections will form between content dusting volunteers and content creators.\nGetting started with content dusting\n\nStep 1 - Find something stale - Find something in any of the Github repositories or Google Drive document that was authored a while ago and you think would be relevant to update. Github content dusting is mostly targeted towards the Handbook, but also other public facing content and software repositories. Google Drive has a lot of spreadsheets, legal paperwork, visuals and much more.\nLet your skills and own perception of « stuff that matters » guide you towards the piece of stale content that you want to update.\n\n\nStep 2 - Put yourself in the author's shoes - Before you even notify them that some of their previous work needs a rework, think of what you would do in their place to get things sorted. Make sure you understand what needs doing to an extent that will allow effective communication with the author.\n\nStep 3 - Notify the author and take steps towards resolution - It's now time to notify the author of the issue you've found. If the content is in a Github file, find the original commit where this content was authored using these insructions, and place a Github comment on the relevant line. If it's on the Drive, just include a comment and mention the author and any other person you think should be notified. Your comment should ideally offer a simple solution to the issue and potentially request mandate to amend the author's work.\n\nGithub tip: You can use the -  [ ] item notation to create a checklist. This will allow you to list tasks that authors will be able give you mandate for by ticking the box. For trivial amendments that you think are not worth disturbing the author, go straigth to committing changes.\n\n\nStep 4 - Publish the changes - Acting upon your words and any clarification the authors gave, amend the content (e.g. by editing the actual files instead of comments on a Google docs, and by and commit your work on Github).\n\nGithub tip: Depending on the repository, it may be useful to use the git tool to clone, create a new branch, commit, and then making a pull-request on Github. Reach out to the #content-dusting Slack channel for any assistance with this workflow.\n\n\nStep 5 - Follow through (but don't burn your wings) - Understand that the author may now be busy with other work, and may need to be reminded several times of the issue. We advice against insisting if authors state that the amendment should not be made. In that case limit the scope of your work to what is actually needed and received as help. Also be extra cautious of complex tasks that would get you stuck for too long. On these, limit step 3 to simple notifications/discussions and reminders, not the actual implementation of a solution.\n\n\nYou can see various examples of (so far Github-centered) content-dusting here (troubleshooting dead links), here (demystifying jargon in the board agreement) and here (updating the member list of the brang working group).\nDiscuss\nThe emergence of this group is discussed in this Loomio. Conversation is also happening in the #activation-program Slack channel. Feel free to join and weight in your thoughts!\n"},"guides/email_accounts.html":{"url":"guides/email_accounts.html","title":"Email accounts","keywords":"","body":"Email accounts guide\nThis guide covers instructions for Enspiral email's, account security, Google groups and Google Drive\nEmail\nTo request an account (if you don't meet the requirements in the Email accounts agreement, contact the Catalysts), or remove your account, fill out this form\nWhat you need to know\n\nAn account allows you to have all the normal google services hosted within Enspiral's Google apps domain. eg. an Enspiral email address and aliasaes, google drive, google calendar and google groups. But an account isn't neccesary to interact with Enspiral people or to use the various services and tools.\nAn account costs 108 NZD per year. This bill is separate to the annual contribution.\nIf you need an account to work for an Enspiral venture, that venture will organise it for you.\n\nAccount security\nOps HIGHLY recommends you keep your account as secure as possible. A few small tweaks will reduce the chance your identity is stolen. Here's some suggestions:\n\nUse a long password. Getting Chrome to remember it is better than nothing (we use 1password and lastpass).\nSetup 2-step authentication. Seriously, it's not worth the risks of not doing it. Do Google's security check up here. Ideally do everything on that page but at the very least setup 2-step and some backup codes in case you get locked out. It'll only ask you for a code every 30 days either via text or the google authenticator app. Use the app if you'll be travelling overseas.\nNext level security is to buy a Yubico key and use that instead of phone or google authenticator. It is more convenient (if you have keys with you) and is far more secure.\nMake sure your software is up-to-date\nSchool up on what phishing is and how to avoid it. There are some really great looking fake gmail login pages out there that will suck up your login details and you won't have a clue you've been hacked, until it's too late. Read this\n\nGoogle Groups\nWhat you need to know\nGroups allow the following functions:\n\nOne shared email home\nEmail forwarding\nGoogle Drive permissions\n\nYou can setup a group in the Enspiral domain or outside it.\nInside Enspiral:\n\nYou can add non Google addresses to the group.\nNon Google addresses can not administer the group, so you need someone with an Enspiral account or Ops to do this.\nIt's a simple way to setup new processes with other Enspiralites.\nIf something goes wrong with the group, Ops can always fix it with their admin accounts.\n\nOutside Enspiral:\n\nYou can add non Google addresses to the group.\nAnyone can administer the group which makes it easy to setup.\n\nUsing Groups for email\n\nA group allows you to have a generic email address @enspiral without setting up another Google account.\nA group can have many members and they can all control whether they receive the emails that are sent to the group.\nIf you want to forward the emails to a particular tool, you can add the tools generic email address as a member of the group. You could also adjust everyone's email settings so they don't receive the emails if it was only for email forwarding.\n\nUsing Groups for Google Drive permissions\n\nIf you share a Google Drive folder with a group, everyone in that group will have access to the folder.\nOnce the folder is shared, you still need to send the link to the folder to everyone in the group.\nOnce each person clicks on the folder link, they need to click on the folder name drop down and select \"Add to My Drive\"\nTo remove the folder from their my drive, all they do is right click on it and select \"Remove\". This will take the folder out of the My Drive but not out of the original place it was created.\n\nEnspiral's Google Drive\n\nEnspiral has one top level folder where everything that's not in the handbook is stored.Get the link from Enspiral's introductions and Readme thread\nEvery contributor is added to a Enspiral Contributor group which has access to some of the Enspiral folders.\nAny file created in one of those folders inherits the permissions of the folder it's in.\nYou can change the permissions on any individual document you create.\nPLEASE DO THIS: When you're sharing with anyone in Enspiral, please make sure the permissions are correct! \"Anyone at Enspiral can find and edit\" only allows people with Enspiral email accounts to edit the document. If you want to share it with everyone, ideally place it in an Enspiral folder which should inherit the correct permissions. To be sure, scroll through who the document has been shared with, it should include \"Foundation Contributors\" Google group. You don't need to individually add everyone if that group is there.\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

Honesty and doing the right thing are just the starting point - true integrity means knowing who we are, what we value, and integrating that with our words and actions. We speak our truth even when it is unpopular, and we do not compromise on what is important.\nPurpose\nWe fundamentally believe our role on this planet is one of service and contribution - we are here to build a better world. We are idealistic, and we are pragmatic. We are motivated by the heart, and we act with considered intelligence. We love fun and new ways to do things, and we can persevere through the hard times. We understand things worth doing aren’t always easy. We are here to make a difference.\nCommitment\nEnspiral is important to us. For some of us it is our life’s work, and for others it is our sole source of income. For all of us, it is a big part of our lives and way up our priority list of where we put our energy.\nGenerosity\nWe give freely of our time and money to help others. This doesn’t mean we will go broke giving what we don’t have, but our natural impulse is to share. We make sacrifices to help those around us, and actively look for opportunities to create and share abundance.\nGood Judgment\nWhen we offer someone membership we are giving them a binding vote in the most important decisions we face as a collective, so we better be sure their judgment is sound. Everyone has their own areas of expertise and experience, but on the whole we look for people who make good decisions.\nLeadership\nWe don’t sit around and talk about what someone else should do to make things better - we act. We don’t always ask permission before starting something new, and we risk failure striving for difficult dreams. Everyone should lead some of the time, but no one should lead all the time. Leadership should be balanced with active followership.\nEngagement\nIn order for us to realise the benefits of distributed power and diverse viewpoints, we need to participate in decision making and discussion. People get busy or distracted at times, but overall engagement is important. This might mean jumping in online, attending meetings, going to retreats, recruiting and supporting new people, and participating in collaborative processes.\nCollaboration\nWe love autonomy and self-determination, but we can add more value working together than on our own. If someone in their hearts is a lone wolf and doesn’t think we can build something better by working together, then membership of this collective is not for them.\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

There is a learning curve but it is worth the effort.\nGit is like a central collaboration trunk with a million services that work on top of it.\nThe first one we use is Github: it's a hosting service for Git repositories.\nGitbooks is another service we use: it turns all the files you see on github.com/enspiral/handbook into the nice browsable, searchable, portable package you can see at handbook.enspiral.com.\nGit lingo: issues, repos, pull requests, and merging\nRepo is short for repository: in Git, all the files for a project live in a repo.\nA Github issue is a public discussion for work-in-progress.\nSo for instance, when I see something wrong with Loomio, I go to the Loomio repo on Github and say \"I found a bug, this thing is broken!\" Then we have a discussion about how to fix it. Sometime later someone can propose a fix, and reference the issue, so when the proposal is accepted, the issue gets closed.\nIn git lingo, the proposal is a pull request and it is accepted by merging in the changes.\nPut your new Git skills to good use\nNow that you have some Git skills, why don't you try proposing a change to this handbook, or suggesting a new issue on the Improvements board\nIf you have any questions that aren't answered by this guide, you can ask them by creating a new issue.\nThe amazing Github intro video series\nGabby made these excellent videos introducing Github for beginners.

When this happens, you can start a conversation with other Enspiral people to see what they think. This could happen in our digital communication spaces, in Working Groups or at Enspiral Retreats.\nOnce we've had a discussion and got a clear understanding of what actions need to happen, then we use the Improvements board to track the work that is happening on Enspiral.\nThe Improvements board\nAll Enspiral people can view the Improvements board. (If you can't access that link, send a quick email to foundation@enspiral.com.)\nHere's what it looks like:\n\nHere's what's going on:\n\nEach card represents a piece of work.\nThe cards fade to gray when they are inactive. In the screenshot above you can see just a few active cards, with their white background.\nCards are sorted into columns, and move from left to right: from \"backlog\" through to \"in progress\" and finally \"done\".\nCards are labeled with coloured tags, each representing a different category of work.\nPress 'F' to find (search) cards. You can search by labels, for instance, here are all the \"help wanted\" cards\nThe person responsble for the work is assigned to the card -- if you want to assign yourself to a job, on Trello you can hover your mouse over the card and then press 'space'.\n\nImprovement lifecycle\nBacklog\nThis is where an improvement starts. It could be a question, a problem or an idea to make things better. It could be a quick note or a lengthy treatise.\nScoping\nOccasionally a heroic individual will emerge from the fog and take responsibility for an improvement. An individual with the energy and vision to bring clarity to chaos, the wisdom to seek advice from their peers and the silvery tongue of a poet to make long sentences short.\nThey do not commit to doing the work but they do clarify and scope the improvement so that others can. Once everything is clear the scoper can gaze boldly towards the horizon, utter a meaningful \"my work here is done\", and stride off into the sunset. The ticket moves to Ready.\nReady\nLike a puppy locked up inside, the improvement languishes in the ready column just waiting for someone to come home and play with them. All they really want is to be outside running and jumping and rolling in the grass. Or some food, any food, but especially those sweet cobudget dollars. \nBut instead they are sitting here in a cold and dark concrete bunker. Alone and waiting for someone to love them, their big saucer eyes gazing falornely at all the strangers on the internet who give them the once over and think \"not today\". \nUntil that someone special arrives.\nIn Progress\nSo much wow! Fireworks, magic, \"oh my god this is really happening\". Idea meets team. Documents are written, money moves, Loomio decisions fly and circles of hands raise towards the heavens with fingers sparkling. Ones turn to zeroes and zeroes turn to ones in their billions. People even talk to each other.\nUntil everyone gets a little bit tired and it's time for a nap and a serious discussion about how it all went.\nCelebrate\nWe share stories and learn from each other about what was, what could have been and what might be next time.\nDone\nWell, that was all terribly exciting! An adventure that will be etched forever in the ticket's comment thread (or until the internet shuts down).\nSprints\nThe Catalysts maintain a 2-weekly rhythm to help coordinate the work. We call each 2-week period a \"sprint\". We look at the Improvement board at least once every sprint and make sure the cards are fresh. This means:\n\nWe close issues in the Backlog that are older than three months with no activity\nWe unassign and shift issues that have been in Scoping for more than a month to the Backlog\nWe shift issues that have been in Ready for more than a month to the Backlog\nWe prompt people assigned to In Progress issues for a status update. If you don't respond by the next sweep we move it to the Backlog\nWe share stories from any Celebrate issues and move them to Done. \nThe Done column automatically consumes the card (nom nom nom) and adds the information to this spreadsheet so we can look back in future and see everrrrrything we've done.\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

Your Steward will ask you questions to understand your intentions and aspirations coming into Enspiral, and introduce you to other people in the network who might share similar dreams.\nAs a new Contributor, your job is to find the people within our network who most resonate with what you want to create in the world. Your Steward is here to help.\nHappy connecting!\nWeek 3 email: So what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?\nKia ora,\nSo what does it mean to be an Enspiral Contributor?\nEnspiral Contributors are the life of Enspiral. But what are you contributing to and how do you do it? Below is an extended version of our People Agreement which sets out what is required, expected and encouraged from Contributors in being valuable citizens of Enspiral.\nRequired:\n\nAccept the invitation to the Enspiral Loomio group\n\nFollow agreed Enspiral policies (such as the Diversity Agreement and the Personal Conduct Agreement)\n\nOpt in after 3 months and every 12 months after that, and make a self-set financial contribution (see Financial Agreement)\n\n\nExpected:\n\nContribute to the internal culture of support and generosity.\n\nParticipate in online communications channels and collective decisions on Loomio.\n\nAllocate funds in Cobudget when you have them.\n\nHelp build Enspiral in your own way - no one here will tell you what to do.\n\nIf you notice something that can be improved, work on it or talk to people about it. Read the Improvements Guide and add your idea to the Improvements Board, or posting a bucket idea in Cobudget are great places to start.\n\nIf you access an opportunity through Enspiral, set it up to contribute back to the network in some way e.g. become an Enspiral Services contributor, contract Enspiral Ventures to work on it.\n\nLearn about our social mission and uphold our values.\n\n\nEncouraged:\n\nAttend Enspiral retreats and events\n\nPropose buckets in Cobudget, and work on other’s projects\n\nRefer opportunities to Enspiral people and ventures\n\nRespond to invitations to participate in network initiatives and contribute to setting the direction of the network\n\nDo commercial work through ventures in the network to enhance your livelihood and that of others\n\n\nGot some thoughts on this? For more background on [this agreement] and to ask questions, see this Loomio discussion.\nHappy contributing!\nEnspiral Foundation\nWeek 4: Getting informed about Enspiral\nKia ora\nHungry to get more informed about Enspiral?\nWe have a multitude of places you can delve into to understand more about the network. Here’s some we can recommend ＼(^o^)／\nRead:\nEnspiral Handbook - a work in progress guide to being part of Enspiral\nEnspiral Tales on Medium - our blog with many diverse authors\nEnspiral FAQ - our answers to your questions. Submit more here.\nWatch:\nEnspiral YouTube channel\nAsk:\nAsk Enspiral group on Loomio\nEnspiral_help channel on Slack\nWe really encourage question-asking at Enspiral. It helps us understand what is clear and what isn’t. So please never hesitate to jump on to Loomio or Slack and ask away!\nHappy exploring!\nWeek 5: Getting active in Enspiral\nKia ora\nTime to get active!\nHopefully by now you’re getting an understanding of the Enspiral spaghetti and are ready to start being an active citizen in our community! Here’s some actions we encourage new Contributors to take.\nAdd your voice to a Loomio discussion happening in the Enspiral Group. Vote in as many decisions as you can - even if you are Abstaining because you don’t have enough context, it’s still valuable participation.\nPropose or help shape an idea by commenting on Cobudget. Maybe you’ve got fresh insights as to how we can make coming into the network better for other people or some other brainwave of how to contribute to the network. Putting up a bucket on Cobudget is the best way to gather people and funds behind your idea.\nPost in Slack, Loomio or Facebook - choose your favourite casual discussion channel and share some inspiration, a question, an idea. Make sure you’ve completed your profile on these platforms so others will know what your passions and focus areas are!\nTake up a challenge in the Activation Program(me) - This aims to support new contributors to become quickly active in the community through a \"learning by doing\" process. It consists in completing a list of easy / intermediate / hard challenges that will help any new contributor know more about Enspiral processes, people and culture.\nCome to an Enspiral Retreat (held every six months). Annually is Summer Festival – a combination of high energy, socially engaging and mentally stimulating experiences as well as a chance to slow down, explore deep conversations, and reflect on your purpose and direction. The result is the unique combination of work and play that we call Enspiral!\nHappy engaging!\nWeek 6: Tell us how you’re going**\nKia ora\nTell us how it's been! A piece of cake? Or something else?\nAt Enspiral we’re constantly working to improve the experience of people in the network in being able to meaningfully participate in our mission of ‘more people working on stuff that matters’ and cultivate an impactful livelihood through involvement in our community.\nYou’re now halfway through your three month trial and we’d love to understand how your experience has been - what’s been valuable and what hasn’t, what’s clear and what’s confusing, and your ideas for improving this on-ramp into Enspiral.\nPlease fill in this Google Form to help us out\nYou can choose to leave your name or submit anonymously if you prefer.\nBig thanks!\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

Members are the new Contributor’s Steward by default unless they have arranged for someone else to be their Steward. \nUpon completion of this Form, Ops receives a notification with all of the details. At the same time, the new Contributor is sent an automated email with a link and request to complete the Contributor Details Form. Ops waits for the new Contributor to complete this form before onboarding them to the Enspiral apps and systems. \nThe new Contributor completes this form, supplying the following info: Facebook login email, personal tagline/origin story, website, ask me about…, skills, activities, values, interests, bio/introduction, aspirations within the network. Ops receives a notification when the form is completed and that the Contributor is ready to be onboarded to the network.\nOps onboards the new Contributor by inviting them to join to the following systems:\n\nEnspiral Loomio\nEnspiral Slack\nSecret Enspiral Facebook Group\nCobudget\nAdded to the Foundation Google Apps Contributors Group\nAdded to receive the Onboarding Email Series\n\nIf the new Contributor is getting an Enspiral Google Apps account, all of the above invites are generally sent to the new Google Apps account address unless the contributor prefers for these to be sent to their personal address.\nAt this point the Contributor is considered “Onboarded” with a “Trial” status. The onboard date is created and a new Opt-in Request date is set for 3 months (90 days) after the onboard date. The Contributors & Members Directory is updated with the new Contributors details.\nOnce the new Contributor has logged into the Loomio Enspiral Group for the first time, Ops receives a notification. Ops introduces the new Contributor in the New contributor welcome and introductions Discussion in Loomio, tagging their inviting Member and Steward, and records the welcome date in the back end database. Ops then invites the new Contributor to join the “Enspiral Opportunities // Ask Enspiral” Enspiral Loomio sub-group.\nThe new Contributor is now fully onboarded to all of Enspiral’s systems.\nAnnual opt-in\nAfter 3 months in the network, and once a year after that, we ask Contributors to proactively decide if they'd like to stay on in the network. (Enspiral members are also contributors, and they go through this same process).\n\nNear the \"Subscription Date\" dictated by the above 3-month or annual Enspiral birthdate, Contributors are sent an email with a custom-link to the Opt-in form. This is sent via Mandrill, with the name \"Charley at Enspiral Foundation\". The email is sent to both the \"preferred email address\" from our database of Contributors. We recently modified this to also send a Slack notification to the contributor about their request to \"Opt-in\". At this point, an email is also sent to the Contributor's Steward, if they have one, suggesting that this is a good time to check in with them, since this is a specific period of time that they'll be considering to Opt-in or out of the network. (Stewards have the option of not receiving this notification.)\n\nTwo weeks after sending the \"Opt-in\" email, if Ops does not receive a response from the contributor, a \"Final Reminder\" email is sent to the contributor at both their personal and enspiral email addresses (if they have one), with their custom opt-in google form link, and a caution that if we do not receive a response within one further week, we'll take it to mean that they're Opting-out by default. We also send a reminder via Enspiral Slack (recently added notification.)\n\nFour weeks after sending the \"Opt-in\" email, if Ops still does not receive a response, we send a \"Farewell\" email to the Contributor (at both email addresses), saying that we will be removing them from Enspiral systems within one week, unless there's been some mistake. At this point, we also send a follow-up email notification to the Contributor's Steward, advising that unless they think there's been some mistake or problem with the contributor opting-in, Ops will opt-out the contributor by default and remove them from Enspiral systems.\n\nFive weeks after sending the \"Opt-in\" email, if Ops has not received any notification from the Contributor or Steward, we presume the Contributor does not wish to stay in the network and we process the Contributor to be removed from the Enspiral Systems\n\n\nOffboarding\nContributors are offboarded from the network: either when they decide to leave the network at the annual opt-in date or by default if they have not responded to the Opt-in requests.\nOps receives a notification that a Contributor would like to Opt-out or has not responded to the Opt-in requests.\nOps removes the Contributor’s accounts from the following Enspiral systems:\n\nEnspiral Loomio Group (this also removes them from the “Ask Enspiral // Enspiral Opportunites sub-group)\nSecret Enspiral Facebook Group\nCobudget (any remaining funds are recycled into the next Cobudget round currently in construction)\nRemoved from the Foundation Google Apps Contributors Group\nRemoved from the Monthly Enspiral Newsletter e-mail list\nSlack: (Note: you cannot fully “remove” users, instead the Contributor’s account is “disabled”)\n\nIf the Contributor has a Google Apps account (a \"name@enspiral.com\" account), they are notified via email and Slack that their Google Apps account will be removed in two weeks. Ops schedules the Google Apps account removal date. After two weeks, the account is removed and any remaining Google Drive documents owned by the contributor is re-assigned to a nominated account managed by Ops. If the Contributor is also in a Venture, Ops updates the repeating invoices to the Venture for the Google Apps account.\n"},"guides/people.html":{"url":"guides/people.html","title":"People*","keywords":"","body":"People\nEnspiral members on the web\nPage still to be completed.\n"},"guides/pods.html":{"url":"guides/pods.html","title":"Pods","keywords":"","body":"Growing our support with pods\nWhat is a pod?\nPods are small groups of people (4 to 5 is suggested) formed by members and contributors of Enspiral. These groups can support us to build relationships across the network – especially with those further from the center – supporting more people to be ‘seen’ and to experience mutual support and care.\nForming a pod\nA pod is formed by a few people coming together around an intention and some principles. An initial invitation is made by a caller, who also coordinates the first video call or meeting.\nThe invitation will often come with the seed of an intention. It could also suggest a format that the group may choose to follow, or some principles and rituals to use through their calls.\nIn summary:\n\nThe intention clearly states the common intent bringing a group together (e.g. studying a topic together or going through a self-development methodology).\n\nPrinciples are the set of rules, protocols and values that define the culture of the pod. You might consider principles around context, meeting rhythm as well as facilitation and hosting duties.\n\nRituals are practices that help boost the interactivity of your calls. It could be as simple as holding a minute of silence at the start of the call.\n\nA format gives your pod a direction and structure over time. It might specify a set of rituals for each session (of a set) or perhaps even activities that participants do in-between calls.\n\n\nYou can refer to the List of Rituals and the List of Formats for inspiration on what to propose to your group. The next section highlights key principles intended to increase the resilience of your pod and the broader set of pods across Enspiral… we're in this to grow (and compost) together!\nRunning a pod\nThere are key areas where principles might be specifically important for all groups:\nAcknowledging Boundaries – What are you up for? And what are you not up for? Talk about your Norms and Boundaries. Eg, being respectful with each other, setting a confidentiality agreement, etc.\nCadence - How often are you meeting? …for how long? Some pods do it every week for a while and then change to longer cadence, fortnightly or monthly. Many meet from either an hour up to an hour and a half. It is up to your pod members to decide. \n\n⚠️ Having a regular time (eg, first Monday of the month) makes it significantly easier to get together. \nIf you don't have a regular time to meet, dedicating a few minutes at the end of each meeting to schedule the next one makes logistics easier and more effective.\n\nPresence - Agree on the minimum number of participants you want to be present to go ahead with a meeting: Do you want everyone to be present every time? Can you go ahead with a meeting if someone can’t make it?\nCycles - When do you stop? When do you reflect? Start with the end in mind or with a moment when you will stop and reflect (also see Retrospective)\nHosting Duties - Should facilitation ‘rotate’ amongst your pod’s members, with a different person attending to the clock, agenda, or people’s speaking time each session? Should you take turns to decide who's in charge of inviting people of the next meeting and providing a link for them to join?\nSetup Concerns - Some pods may want to commit to certain basics, such as being able to see one another’s faces.\n\n⚠️ Starting a slack channel or Loomio group (especially if not everyone is in Enspiral’s Slack) will help everyone know where to find key info and updates.\n\nNaming Your Elders - What’s the lineage that you are following? Who are you emulating or modelling after?\nContinuous improvement\n  There are two ways you can help make your pod experience increasingly useful to its members and others:\nRetrospective - Agree on a time to stop and reflect on how is the pod working for each member: What is working well? What can be better? What are we going to change? You can use that reflection point as a good place to decide if you stop or if you keep on going, and how.\n\n  ℹ️ For an easy 'how to,' go to the Retro section under “Rituals”\n\nSharing learnings - Share what you learn in your Retro with the network so we can all learn together. We will have shared learning prompts with the network every 3 months, and an open thread where everyone can post what have they learned from specific Formats and Rituals.\nThe pods process at Enspiral\n\nEvery 4-6 months the pods working group will put a callout to the network for new pods formation.\nPeople interested in being Callers or joining a new pod will opt-in, share what they're interested in, and find their pod members in compatible timezones.\nPods will form around the Intention, Principles and Format they choose, based on what the people in them agree on.\nIn advance of the next round, the pod working group will start a thread to encourage pods to do Retrospectives and collect and share lessons for the whole network.\nOnce a pod ends we will encourage people exiting a pod to either join another pod or become caller for new ones.\n\nList of Formats\n\n   Care Pod - A format based on Intentional Change Theory [click to expand]\nPersonal-professional development centered around Intentional Change Theory (ICT), a process for achieving sustained desired change in oneself alongside peers. ICT itself is a powerful pattern that can be approached in a variety of ways. Feel free to create some exercises or agendas from scratch or use the ones presented here. Four pods reported they had good experiences using the exercises outlined in this Format’s documentation.\n\n\n\n   Peer Incubator - Personal-professional development that is more project-oriented than the “Care Pod” format. [click to expand]\nThe documentation of how the very first one evolved can give a picture of how to bring a pod together and evolve your own Format along with some starter material, prompts, and agendas.\nThere are examples of combining this Format with the exercises from Care Pod (ICT), and also a super simple, reusable agenda that is just a combination of the Project Kitchen & Share-and-tell Rituals (see below).\nFind all the documentation about this format here.\n\n\n\n  Free Format - Less structured, build your own… [click to expand]\nWhile a Shared intention and a few Principles or key protocols are recommended, some pods may want to lean into emergence and arrive with a barebones agenda or none at all. Whatever the case, you might like to use one or more of the Rituals below, or to plan and build a Format by remixing those presented above.\n\n\n\nList of Rituals\n\n  Presence in silence - Hold a moment of silence at the beginning of a call [click to expand] \nLife can be hectic and participant may have rushed into the call with stress and other thoughts in mind. Keeping silent for a few minutes (even just 1) can help ground everyone into the moment and improve the capacity of immediacy of the participants.\n\n\n\n  Showing up with a treasure - Join the meeting with a physical object... [click to expand]\nIt could have intrinsic subjective value or be anything helping you illustrate a short story that is important to you. Presenting it during the opening of the call can yield multiple benefits, starting with remembering ourselves what it is we treasure in life, practising storytelling and giving an opportunity to other pod members to get to know you.\n\n\n\n  Share and tell - Share stuff you’re proud of (or fascinated with) and dialogue [click to expand]\nThis is an invitation for folks to first and foremost share something they’ve produced or they’re proud of, and then (if not that) secondarily anything that’s inspired them, that fascinates them, or may support insights for (members of) the group or good dialogue.\n\n\nProject Kitchens - A practical, project-oriented exercise. [click to expand]\nThis exercise will help small groups build collective intelligence by giving mutual support to their projects; see here\n\nCase Clinic - From Theory U [click to expand]\nSimilar to the Project Kitchen with some different nuances and perhaps a broader scope (but each can be modified in length or content to suit your pod). Case Clinic is best suited to groups with a stronger focus on personal-professional development; see here.\n\n\nRetrospective - Reflecting, periodically, for continuous improvement [click to expand]\nThis simple Retro format covers the very basics. You can find a variety of options in this directory of retro formats (including the 4 L’s)\n\n\nA few other basic rituals, such as check ins (one of the most used!) can be found in our handy guide, Workshop patterns.\nRituals for initiating\n\n  3 conversations  - Three conversations for initiating a group [click to expand]\n\n   How do we want to interact together? What’s the intention – or the outcomes or experiences that are hoped for – of our meetings?\n   a. You can ask things like, ‘what would be wildly ideal’ and ‘what would spoil this for you’... exploring the extremes of what would be good for each individual can help you create healthy boundaries and expectations for the group\n   \n\n  What recurring meeting time could work for us?\n  a. having a concrete cadence, not having to find a time again and again, has a big impact on your group’s chances!\n  \n\n  What are folks ready to commit to?\n\n  a. This is the culminating question of the previous two explorations, and also gives people a concrete sense of ownership and dedication to the plan you laid out\n  b. It’s helpful if the commitment question includes a proposal of a duration—at the end of which you’ll have a retrospective or group reflection—in addition to the intention and cadence\n\n\n\n\n  Survey of Interest - Find alignment and participants [click to expand]\nOne way to easily gather the ideal mix of participants is to do a survey. This can also help a group to find or strengthen its shared intention or to choose rituals/ format. You can take advantage of this template survey of interest which can help your pod illuminate its shared intention; you might include this in your invitation to track who is saying yes.\n\n"},"guides/project_kitchen.html":{"url":"guides/project_kitchen.html","title":"Project Kitchens","keywords":"","body":"Project Kitchen\n\nThe Project Kitchen methodology was developed by Seb Paquet and is an energising process for efficiently giving mutual support to projects through enabling group intelligence. We've also found this invaluable for cross-pollinating between different initiatives in the network. It can be done in-person or online using Google Hangouts or similar platform.\n\n\nProject Kitchen background\nProject Kitchens are a socially curated, facilitated, and efficient way of moving projects forward. \nThe format brings together a small number of people who have projects they would like assistance with and puts one project at a time under the spotlight for around 25 minutes. Generally 3-4 projects can be covered in a 2-hour Kitchen. A Chef facilitates; with the role of creating an atmosphere of trust, keeping things rolling, and avoiding wasting time through the process.\nThe Project Kitchen method gives participants concrete ideas and encouragement for moving forward in their projects or ventures, a better idea of other participants’ contexts and needs, and generates a stronger sense of togetherness. As a bonus, it sharpens listening skills and ability to ask for help. It feels fun and is time-efficient.\n\nProject Kitchen process\n\nCheck-ins - Each person in the group is invited to respond to the question 'How are you and why have you come today?' This gets everyone present. \n\nOverview of Project Kitchen - The Chef describes the Project Kitchen - how it developed, what it's designed to do, and a high level view of how it's going to roll.\n\nNotes document - We create a Google Doc, share with participants and 2-3 people offer to write up notes for the session. These notes are often hugely valuable to distribute further than the group who attends the Project Kitchen as they have concise information about what different people are working on and what they would like help with.\n\nWho has projects? Ask the group who has projects they would like help with. Four is ideal for a 2-hour session. If you have more projects than this then the group can make a decision of what projects to prioritise [see also : Roomio]. Once you've decided what projects to engage in, the Project Kitchen choreography can begin with the first project.\n\nChoreography\n\nContext : Project holder talks about their project - giving the context the group needs to understand what they're working on and what burning question or issue they might like the group's brains on. [4 mins]\n\nQ&A : The group asks the project holder rapid-fire questions to get more of the background. Both the questions and answers should be as concise as possible to maximise the number of questions answered. The Chef can intervene if someone is talking rather than questioning. [4 mins]\n\nBurning question : The project holder articulates a focussed question or issue that they would like the group's help with. [1 min]\n\nDiscussion : The group holds a generative discussion of ideas to help the project holder with their identified issue. The project holder is not allowed to speak - they can only take notes. The Chef helps the discussion stay focussed and makes sure there is room for everyone's voice to be heard. [8 mins]\n\nHarvest : The project holder reflects back to the group what was valuable and actionable from their discussion. [3 mins]\n\nRinse and repeat : Process is repeated for other projects on the table.\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck-out - Each person in the group is invited to talk briefly about their experience of the Project Kitchen process and what value they got out of it.\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

Start by interviewing them, so that you have a picture of where they are at with the story and which course they intends to steer it. If your guts tell you to trust them then tell your story. If not, politely excuse yourself saying that your work goes on a different direction that is not connected to that story.\nOffer to help further, and without pushing for it, show availability to read their take on the interview before publishing.

Feel free to edit wildly!\nOpening session\nThe opening and closing sessions are hugely important.\nContext\n\nabout the hosts and location\nour agenda (where are we going on this journey?)\nour objectives (what is the destination? e.g. new relationships, new collaborations)\n\"housekeeping\" announcements, e.g. food, beds, comfort, health & safety, etc.\n\nCircle\n\nHearing everyone's voice early on helps people arrive. It's very discouraging to spend a few days in an event without getting the opportunity to speak your mind to the group.\nMany people will not raise their hand in a Q&A session, so to get people talking, we always open with a round. For events up to 100 people, we sit everyone in a circle (everyone can see everyone) and go round speaking one at a time. In larger groups, we might break out into multiple circles.\nIf time is short, people can speak very briefly, e.g just answering, \"What's your name? Where have you come from? What's one word to describe how you're feeling?\" If there is more time, we would ask a bigger question like, \"What do you want to get from this event? What do you want to contribute?\" or \"Tell us something about your home town.\"\n\nInspiration\n\nSet the tone of the event with an inspirational talk, e.g. from one of the elders, or an upcoming young leader.\n\nClosing session\nWe always end the event with a closing circle, hearing once more from everyone. Prompting questions could be like \"what was the most memorable experience?\", \"what is one new idea you're taking home?\", \"what action will you take when you get home\" etc. Hearing about everyone's experiences adds a lot of impact as you begin to appreciate the great diversity of outcomes and intentions resulting from this gathering.\nForms\nIn addition to the big circle, we use many different forms to encourage collaboration. For instance:\nOpen Space\nOpen Space is a very specific and simple set of rules that allow a group to collaboratively decide how they want to spend their time together. Open Space works best when the hosts follow the rules exactly. Here's a short explanation to give you an idea, but I'd recommend reading more or talking with an expert:\nAnyone can host any session: from a practical workshop, to a gaming session, outdoor recreation, or deep technical discussion.\nWe'd usually half a day (or sometimes much more) in Open Space. The available time is divided into slots, say 6x 40 minute slots for a half day.\nAnyone can make a short (\nThen everyone can pick and choose which activities they're interested in. People are encouraged to only stay so long as they feel they are contributing. It's fine to move between simultaneous events happening at different locations.\nHome groups\nProvide some structure to encourage people to make new relationships. E.g., if we have a large group, we'll break it up into smaller \"home groups\" of say 3-7 people with an intentional mix of ages, nationalities, skills etc. In the agenda, we have home group time periodically (e.g. once per day, or at the beginning, middle and end of the event).\nMany people are much more comfortable participating in a small group than a large group. These home groups are an ideal way for people to reflect together on their experiences. They also allow for a much greater degree of intimacy, and more appreciation for diversity to develop between participants.\nPrinciples\n\nEverybody contributes: this could be as simple as a roster for cleaning up after meals, or something a little bigger like hosting a warm up exercise to start the day. Minimise the distance between hosts and participants.\nEmergence: leave plenty of space in the agenda for unexpected discussions and activities. You can never fully predict what is best for a group before they gather. Open Space is one of many techniques to foster this emergence.\nAutonomy: make it easy for people to excuse themselves from a session, change the temperature for their comfort, or get refreshments when they're thirsty. Make it clear if some sessions are compulsory.\nDiversity: account for the many different needs of participants. Some people are very energetic, others will need plenty of rest and quiet. Consider people's physical needs, e.g. diet and mobility.\n\nLogistics\nIdeally, we host events somewhere with a space big enough for everyone to work in at once. Also it is useful to have many small break-out rooms for teams to work together. Sleeping is usually in dorms (e.g. 8 people in one room) to save expense. Ideally the location will be nearby some recreational area, e.g. beach, river, park, walking tracks etc.\nWe try to spend minimal time in transport, i.e. spending almost all the time at one location, with perhaps one field trip. People in transit usually go into \"waiting mode\" rather than collaborating.\n\nPlease feel free to update this section of the handbook.

Explained with a brief description, plus some insights into why it works, or what principle it illustrates. Please add to this list and modify as you please :)\nCheck in\nProcess: We start events with a check in. Everyone in a circle, sitting or standing (more energetic). Facilitator gives a prompt, then we go around and hear from everybody, e.g. how are you feeling on a scale 1-5?, or, what’s something you feel grateful for this morning? Remind people to be brief. Funny ice breaker questions can break tensions if the group doesn’t work together often (e.g. “each of you has a super power, what’s yours?”)\nYou can also invite people to say what they are looking forward to in the workshop or what they would like to get out of it.\nRationale: Demonstrates that all voices are important. Also, we care about how you’re feeling.\nAgenda/Programme/Timeline\nProcess: Ensure that a rough outline of the day is written up on the wall. Go through it in a bit of detail at the beginning.\nRationale: This gives people a lay of the land and an overview of what to expect and how to orientate themselves in it.\nCommunication Protocol\nProcess: Start by getting suggestions from the crowd: how should we communicate together? E.g. with generosity, care, fun, honesty, openness, respect, concise, joy, etc. Write them on a whiteboard. You can refer back to the whiteboard to remind people of our shared agreement, e.g. when you break from big group into small group discussions: \"remember we said we would be kind and honest.\"\nRationale Makes our communication explicit, and malleable: something we can create intentionally, rather than just accepting a default from majority culture.\nTwinkle fingers/snaps\nProcess Introduce new ways of communication, e.g. you can sparkle/twinkle your fingers, or snap/click to  show support or celebrate what someone has said. E.g. at the end of a talk, we all snap our fingers. Or in a small group, when someone says something that really moves me, I twinkle at them.\nRationale This creative non-verbal communication takes up less time- and audio-space than clapping. Very easy introduction to the idea that different communication tools have different outcomes. And somehow it feels really great when a lot of people twinkle at you :)\nHand up-Mouth Shut\nProcess: Another great non-verbal communication trick. Introduce this process at the start of an event: When you want the room to be quiet, put your hand up and close your mouth. When you see someone with a hand up, you copy them: hands up, mouth shut.\nRationale A simple way to get the groups attention without having to lose your voice or clap or make some other crazy loud sound. Also, anyone can get the attention of the room, not just the facilitator.\nDot voting\nProcess: Get people to brainstorm ideas on post it notes, gather those post it notes on a wall. Then say that everyone has four dots to put on their favourite ones. The ones with the most dots will get picked.\nEg This could be used to decide which four topics you will cover in the afternoon\n1-2-4-All\nProcess\nShare a story or present a question. Get people to reflect individually for one minute. Then they share reflections with another person for 2 minutes (1 minute each, facilitator signs when one minute has passed so that the other person can talk). Then bring them into groups of four for 4 minutes to share what resonates. Depending on the number of participants the same could be done in groups of 8 for 8 minutes. Facilitator makes sure everyone had the opportunity to talk and if someone is taking too much space in the conversation. The idea is to achieve consensus or consent in what resonates with the whole group and present back to all the participants. Facilitator takes notes of the group ideas in the wall.\nRationale\nAn accessible way of practicing collective decision-making. After that experience Loomio could be introduced as a tool that does a similar process online. Also a practice that could contribute to design a participatory workshop where groups choose the topics they would like to learn and facilitators customize the content and exercises to match the expectations of the participants.\nCommitment to Action\nAt the end of the event, everyone decides one thing they are going to do. Share it out loud to make a commitment in front of others.\nRoomio\nProcess: After you have introduced Loomio as an online concept show how you can also do it face to face. Explain what the thumb signals mean.\nIf you have time it can be great to break people up into smaller groups to discuss the differences between the different signals. Especially get them to talk about the difference between a \"disagree\" and \"block\".\nFishbowl discussion\nProcess\nA fishbowl discussion is suited to large groups. To set up the conversation, place 5 chairs in an inner circle. This is the fishbowl. Select four people to occupy chairs in the fishbowl, and leave one seat unoccupied. Only people occupying chairs in the fishbowl are allowed to speak. The audience members sit or stand around the fishbowl and listen to the discussion. At any time, a member of the audience can join the discussion by occupying the empty chair in the fishbowl. When this happens, an existing member of the fishbowl must voluntarily leave the fishbowl and free up another chair. The discussion progresses with people freely entering and leaving the fishbowl.\nRationale\nThis format emphasises Enspiral’s ethic of self-responsibility within a large group. If someone has certain needs/wants for how the discussion unfolds, then they have the opportunity to voice that need and/or steer the discussion accordingly.\nHuman Spectogram\nProcess\nPeople show where they stand on a spectrum— sometimes an issue with two extremes— by moving to the point between the two spatially-designated points that reflects their views (this side of the room is \"strongly agree\"... opposite side is \"strongly disagree\"); facilitator asks people from each extreme and from the middle to share with the group why they are standing where they are. There are tweaks and additional resources here.\nRationale\nThis supports those who are better kinesthetic and/or visual-spatial learners. It is a way for the group to get a better sense of the diverse opinions and experiences within itself. Getting up and moving around can be a good way to add some energy to a workshop and can be a useful transition.\nStewardship exercise\nProcess\nIntroduce the concept of the Stewardship process adopted in Enspiral and the importance of having a specific time and regular rhythm to share with another colleague your needs and aspirations. Divide the group into pairs and give them 6 minutes to share what they need to do their best work. Facilitator signs after 3 minutes so that the other person can talk. Here is an example of a Stewardship exercise with a network of consultants.\nRationale\nAn accessible way of practicing peer-to-peer support and understanding how personal development and support can happen in a decentralised network.\nRetrospective\nProcess: At the end of the workshop run a retrospective\nHow you do this tends to depend on how much time you have and how much trust you have built within the participants. One way is to give everyone three post it notes and on one they write something like likes, one something they did not like, and something they would recommend to change.\nLetter to self\nProcess: Invite people to write a letter to their future self. You can encourage them to write something to remind them of today, to make a commitment to their future self\nTeam\nProcess: Ensure all the team have introduced them self\nCheck out\nProcess: If there is time at the end, end like you began and do a check out. You could ask: What are you leaving with? What was your key insight?\nResources\nhttp://www.liberatingstructures.com/ls/\nhttp://toolbox.hyperisland.com/\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

Ambassadors are people who are confident and supported to represent Enspiral and maintain long term relationships with external groups and individuals.\nWhat do Ambassadors do?\nThey spend time with people and help them find opportunities to collaborate with Enspiral people and Ventures. This involves lots of calls and face to face meetings, spending the time to understand other organisations and hunting for meaningful value exchanges. \nI've found someone I want an Ambassador to talk to, what to do?\nOoh, we love introductions! You can either post a message in our slack group or send an email to ambassadors@enspiral.com\nI'm looking for an introduction to one of our friends, can Ambassadors help?\nAbsolutely. We know literally tons of people (well, tens of tons actually, people are heavy!) - just post up in our slack channel what sort of connection you are looking for and we will do our best to help.\nWho are our current Ambassadors?\n\nJoshua Vial\nSusan Basterfield\nDamian Sligo-Green\nGenevieve Parkes\nKate Beecroft\nLucas Tauil de Freitas\nRichard Bartlett\nRose Lu\nSandra Chemin\nTamas Hovanyecz\n\nAmbassadoring\nHow do I become an Ambassador?\nJump up in the #ambassadors slack channel and talk to the other Ambassadors. This role is open to both Members and Contributors, the more you know about Enspiral then the easier the work is but if you're still finding your way then the old hands are happy to pair with you. Once both you and the other Ambassadors are confident you will be invited to our Loomio group, added to hubspot and be an official Ambassador.\nWhat are the commitments of being an Ambassador?\nYou are expected to log your 'official' Ambassador calls you make in the slack channel and Hubspot so other Ambassadors have visibility on the relationships you are maintaining. If you step back from Ambassador work you are expected to make introductions to other Ambassadors who can continue the relationship.\nIs it paid?\nNo, we don't have the resources to pay for Ambassadoring so this is a volunteer role. \nAre there any time commitments?\nNo, you are free to do as much or as little Ambassadoring as you like. \nHow do I step back?\nWe run a standard 6 monthly opt in to stay an Ambassador which is a good time to reflect on your commitments. You can also step back whenever feels right. Don't worry, you'll be welcome back anytime :)\nWhere do Ambassadors meet?\nYou can find us at #ambassadors on slack and in our Loomio Group. We occasionally have Ambassador calls to sync up.\nMeh, I'm not up for all this process, but I do represent Enspiral and meet interesting folks from time to time.\nNo problems, it would help us if you dropped a message in the #ambassadors slack channel but fly free you free spirit you.\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

(Specifically this email is triggered using Zapier). The invoice must include: the total amount for the bucket (Amounts in Cobudget are GST-exclusive), bucket name and URL, a clear indication of whether GST is included in your invoice, and the recipient's bank account number.\nThe bucket owner sends the invoice to Foundation and Ops enters this in Xero as a bill for payment.\nThe 'real money' payment is made from the Collab Funding account to the recipient and Ops changes the status of the bucket in the spreadsheet to 'Paid' and records any necessary comments. The bucket balance total in this spreadsheet is reduced accordingly. \nSimultaneously, at the start of a funding round, GT add funds from the Audit Log list of queued funds to individual's accounts.\nOnce GT have confirmed that funds have been allocated, Ops audits the total in Cobudget with the spreadsheet dashboard and makes a once-monthly transfer in/out of the Collab-funding account to/from the Invoices/Expenses account or Reserves.\nGT facilitates and opens the new funding round and the above process repeats at the end/beginning of the next cycle.\nOps marks the bucket in Cobudget as 'Completed'.\n\nHow to get paid for a Cobudget Bucket\nOnce you've proposed a Bucket and it gets Funded (Woohoo! High-five!!), at the end of the funding round you will be contacted by email with a request to send an invoice to Enspiral Foundation via foundation@enspiral.com.\nIn your invoice, be sure to include:\n\nthe total amount for the bucket (remember, the amounts in Cobudget are GST-exclusive)\nbucket name and URL\na clear indication of whether GST is included in your invoice\nbank account number\n\nDetailed Ops Processes for Cobudget\nOps is working with the Greaterthan (GT) team to deliver collaborative funding for the network through Cobudget. Cobudget is currently run in monthly funding rounds. The following is a detailed description of the operational processes that back up the action on Cobudget and in the Enspiral Foundation bank accounts. (Contributors only: view this Loomio discussion for the latest discussion about collaborative funding rounds.)\nEnspiral Foundation has a dedicated \"Collab Funding\" bank account, which is the \"real money\" that underwrites the funds circulating Cobudget. Ops runs a spreadsheet database in collaboration with GT as a bridge between Cobudget and the bank account. While Cobudget continues to be developed, the total funds in the Collab Funding  account is comprised of the following allocations/breakdown of this total in Cobudget:\n\nAvailable Funds - this appears at the top of the screen and shows the total unspent funds in your individual account. The figure to the right of this shows the total 'unspent funds' for the whole group, including: unspent funds in all individual accounts, including invited users with funds.\nTotal Incomplete - this is the total value of funded incomplete buckets\n\"Funded Now\" Total in \"Funding\" Buckets - this is the total amount of funds that have been allocated to \"Funding\" buckets\nCompleted Unpaid Buckets - this is the total amount of funds sitting in \"Completed\" but \"Unpaid\" buckets, that is buckets that haven't been paid out with real money from the Collab Funding bank account.\n\nNot all of the above is clearly represented at present in Cobudget. As such, Ops and GT use a spreadsheet to track the total funds in Cobudget vs. the total in the Collab Funding account.\nHow funds enter Cobudget\nContributors can allocate funds to their individual Cobudget account as part of the annual Opt-in process or via the  Variable contributions form. For tax purposes, Variable contributions are treated differently than the funds allocated as part of annual Opt-ins. (View the above link for further details about this). \nOnce this money is received in the Enspiral Foundation bank account, Ops reconciles the bank payment in Xero and adds a record of this payment to the Cobudget \"Audit log\". This list of users and Cobudget contributions in the Audit Log are queued up for the subsequent funding round. At the start of a funding round, these funds are added to individual contributor accounts. Ventures also make contributions to Cobudget to team accounts; these payments are similarly recorded into this audit log.\nHere's a link to the Financial Agreement\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

This is the process for collaborative spending with Enspiral. There is a different place to go to pay your Enspiral contribution.\nTax Implications of cobudget funds / variable Contributions.\nIn April 2016 we received advice from Deloitte. \nFrom an IRD point of view the contributions are a gift and won’t be taxable or have GST charged on them. They are not tax deductible for the giving party and need to be paid with post tax money.\nThe gifts are not classed as income for the foundation - they go straight onto the balance sheet and no tax is paid on them.\nGifts from Individuals\nGifts from individuals are made using post tax money and are not tax deductible. \nGifts from Businesses\nGifts from business are not tax deductible, unlike yearly contributor fees or monthly venture fees.\nBecause business gifts are paid with pre-tax funds, the business will need to keep 28% aside for the future tax bill.\nFor the initial release of the Variable Contribution process, the gift amount entered by businesses is treated as the post-tax amount after 28% has been set aside for tax.  \nFor example, if a business enters $100 into the Variable Contribution Form it will keep an additional $38.89 (28%) set aside for tax.  \nBusiness Tax Component Calculation\nBusinesses gifting funds to Enspiral Foundation are responsible for setting aside and managing tax on donations. Businesses can calculate the tax to keep aside using this formula:  \n($x / (1-.28))-$x\n$100 gift example: \n\n($100/.72)-$100 = $38.89. \nFoundation receives $100. \nBusiness keeps $38.89 aside for tax. \n\n$350 gift example:\n\n($350/.72)-$350 = $136.11 tax. \nFoundation receives $350. \nBusiness keeps $136.11 aside for tax.\n\n\nIf you can see room for improvement, please feel free to edit this page.

ActionStation became an official Enspiral venture in 2015. \nLegal structure\nActionStation operates as a not-for-profit LLC, the sole shareholder of which is an incorporated society (ActionStation Aotearoa Inc) made up of ActionStation members.\nBusiness Model\nOur main source of income is small contributions (either one-off for specific campaigns or recurring) from our membership base. We also have a few grants to supplement that base of member-funding as we grow but the long-term plan is to be entirely funded by members. \nActionStation is a not-for-profit so our growth model is driven by capacity to have greater impact on progressive change in New Zealand, rather than financial growth for it’s own sake. \nSocial Impact Strategy / Theory of Change\nOur social impact goals are two fold:\nTo build a more connected, confident and active community of progressive New Zealanders who act together to hold power to account in support of the following social impacts;\nA fair society, healthy environment, transparent and accountable decision-making including politics and ethical business conduct. \nWe do this by building a large-scale independent, progressive multi-issue movement that enables New Zealanders who share broadly progressive values to take powerful, coordinated action online and offline. We are building power and momentum to hold political and corporate interest to account. \nSpecifically we do this by bringing the substantial weight of public opinion and collective action to bear on key social issues at moments of ‘heat’ and opportunity for change, with the goal of moving the issue towards the desired social impact goals outlined above. \n\nVenture Stewards \n\nMarianne Elliott\nPhill Coxon\nBen Knight/Hannah Salmon\n\nEnspiral Foundation Contribution\n\nFinancial: 1% of recurring member donations\nNon-financial: ActionStation team members are active in the Enspiral network\n\n"},"ventures/enspiral_academy.html":{"url":"ventures/enspiral_academy.html","title":"Enspiral Academy","keywords":"","body":"Enspiral Academy Venture Profile\nVenture Description\nEnspiral Academy focuses on education for emerging industries.

Its mission is to support the network as a whole, facilitate collaboration between the people and ventures, and further the overall social mission of Enspiral. It is a 'meta' venture that can be imagined as a hub, a platform, an umbrella, or a garden. The Foundation is governed by its constitution, stewarded by its directors, and is intended to be a lean platform upon which distributed leadership, experimentation, collaboration, and interdependence can thrive, enhancing all the diverse expressions of Enspiral's values through the various purposes of the people and ventures within the network.\nKey personnel\n\nAnts Cabraal - Director\nBart De Vries - Director\nRobert Guthrie - Director\nSusan Basterfield - Director\nEnspiral Members - Shareholders\nEnspiral Ops - Administration\n\nContact: Enspiral Ops, foundation@enspiral.com\nLinks\n\nwebsite: www.enspiral.com\nhandbook: handbook.enspiral.com\n\nFounding Date & Brief History\nThe Enspiral Foundation was formed in 2012, as part of Enspiral's transition from a single venture to a network of ventures that use the Foundation as a vehicle for collaboration. The past board members have included Joshua Vial, Josh Forde, Anake Goodall, and Vivian Maidaborn.\nLegal structure\nLimited liability company with a charitable constitution. The Foundation is owned collectively by the Enspiral Members, who each hold a single share that represents decision-making stakeholding and stewardship. Shares are non-dividend baring, and all income is re-invested in the network and achieving the social mission.\nBusiness Model\nThe Foundation's income is made up of paid contributions from individuals and ventures in the Enspiral network. The Foundation also has occasionally received grant funding.\nIn the past, the Foundation has run initiatives that generated direct income, but these will be minimised in the future due to the approach of minimal governance and lean operations - instead initiatives will live in other entities and agreements will be made for contributions from them to the Foundation on a case by case basis.\nMore details about money and the Foundation can be found here.\nSocial Impact Strategy / Theory of Change\nThe Enspiral Foundation exists to support the people and ventures of the Enspiral network to each achieve their social impact missions. The reason the Foundation exists is rooted in the belief that we can achieve more through mutual support, interdependence, and cooperation than as isolated individuals and companies. Much of the Foundation's work operates on a 'meta' level, creating the conditions and systems with which people and entities driving direct social impact can be more effective.\nEverything the Foundation does is oriented toward the loosely defined mission of Enspiral: \"More people working on stuff that matters.\"\n\nVenture Stewards\n\nRobert Guthrie\nAnts Cabraal\nBart de Vries\nSusan Basterfield\n\nEnspiral Foundation Contribution\n100% of income to the Foundation is re-invested in the network.\n"},"ventures/exp.html":{"url":"ventures/exp.html","title":"EXP","keywords":"","body":"EXP Venture Profile\nVenture Description\nEXP runs events, conferences and hosts retreats within the Enspiral network - also offers consulting services in facilitation, programme design & delivery and entrepreneurship coaching. \nKey personnel\n\nAnts Cabraal - Diretor\nSilvia Zuur - Director\nBilly Matheson - Director\n\nContact Person\nSilvia Zuur\nLinks to website or other resources\nwww.exp.agency\nQuarterly Update\nJuly 2016\n\nOur first three months of business at EXP - whoop!

At our very first event we met Marusha, a 16yo girl with Cerebral Palsy. She had been unable to control her wheelchair, or use her computer’s joystick mouse because of the spasticity in her hands. She was quoted $1000 and was waiting 8 months for a solution. Within 4 hours we designed and 3D Printed a custom joystick for her, for a material cost of just 37c! As we saw her driving around we all knew that something magical was happening there, and we were hooked. \nIn October 2015 we won the people's choice and judge's choice award at NDIS New World National Pitch Competition in Brisbane.
