While this guide is a placeholder, it still may provide valuable guidance for how to support people newly joining the network via a pairing (like Stewarding used to do).

# How to budy well - step by step - to support someone’s enspiral onboarding ~Stewarding - doing it well~ ¹

Set up a casual conversation time, perhaps after work or at lunchtime, and have a coaching-like check in with your listened-to steward which covers personal and professional conversations topics.

## Things you might discuss

- How is your wider life going?
- How is work going for you?
- How is this community feeling for you right now?
- And your role in it?
- How can I best support you?
- In the last month where did you get to with previously discussed goals? (if there were any)
- What did you like/ dislike, what would you change?
- What do you want to do this month?
- What are your longer term goals?
- Is there anything you want to check in on again at our next meeting?

## Things that can contribute to great steward meetings

- Clear meeting times
- Google cal so you both have a record
- Make the length clear if you have to leave (~30 mins is a good minimum?)
- Make them one-on-one, and in person (where possible)
- Listen more than you talk
- Ask how you can support before suggesting a solution
- Clear outcomes
- Be clear on what, if any, action points are for you, or for your buddy ~steward~
- Ask your buddy ~steward~ to email a summary of action points/ goals/ things to check in on later (no pressure)

## Opening up a new buddying ~stewarding~ relationship

In addition to above, you could ask what are your expectations for stewarding, how do you think it might support you?

- How have you found working with teams like this in the past?
- What has it been like for you to engage on the technology platforms for communication?
- Are you feeling comfortable about your place in this group?
- Is there anything you’re worried about?

## Safety and Communication

Stewards aren’t counsellors but they can support their listened-to stewards to talk through challenging feelings, about anything they feel comfortable with. Talk with others who steward you or who you steward to identify how confidential the things they share with you are. In small communities it’s easy for a harsh comment to travel around a group even though it was part of a normal venting process that was never meant to be passed on. Don’t turn your stewarding circle into a gossip chamber.
